### AmazonS3 ESB Connector

The Amazon S3 connector allows you to access the REST API of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), which provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon S3 uses to run its own global network of websites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass on those benefits to developers.
