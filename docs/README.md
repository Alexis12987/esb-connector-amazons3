# AmazonS3 EI Connector

The AmazonS3 [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the REST API of [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html), which provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon S3 uses to run its own global network of websites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass on those benefits to developers.

## Getting started
To get started, go to [Configuring Amazon S3 Operations](config.md). Once you have completed your configurations, you can perform various operations with the connector.
